# java-graphics-rendering

These files are part of a project I worked on for Computer Graphics class. I have just decided to put these up,
so bare with me more is coming! When put all together the project can draw filled and wireframe polygons (mainly triangles)
with bilinear and linear interpolation to produce color gradients. I have also implemented z-buffering, depth-cueing and more.
I will be uploading screenshots very soon.
